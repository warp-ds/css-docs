## Quick reference

::: Warning
  Known problem: the shortcuts `aspect-ratio`, `aspect-square`, `aspect-video` are not working as intended
:::

| Class               | Description                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `aspect-ratio`      | aspect-ratio: auto;                     |
| `aspect-square`     | aspect-ratio: 1/1;                      |
| `aspect-video`      | aspect-ratio: 16/9;                     |
| `aspect-1/1`        | Sets the aspect ratio to 1:1            |
| `aspect-4/3`        | Sets the aspect ratio to 4:3            |
| `aspect-16/9`       | Sets the aspect ratio to 16:9           |
| `aspect-2/1`        | Sets the aspect ratio to 2:1            |
| `aspect-{fraction}` | Sets the aspect ratio to any {fraction} |

> `{fraction}`: _Any fraction is valid - e.g. `1/5`_


::: tip Note
Aspect ratio support is currently provided via the ['padding-bottom'](https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes/) fallback method. The built-in `aspect-ratio` property is not yet well supported.

## Basic usage

### Setting the aspect ratio

Use the aspect-{ratio} utilities to set the desired aspect ratio of an element.

<width-controller>
  <container>
    <div class="flex justify-center aspect-2/1 rounded-4 overflow-hidden">
      <img src="/50s-scientists.jpg" class="object-cover" alt="AI generated picture of 1950s scientists working on a warp drive" />
    </div>
  </container>
</width-controller>

```html
<div class="aspect-2/1">
  <img class="object-cover" src="..." alt="..." />
</div>
```

<width-controller>
  <container>
    <div class="flex justify-center aspect-1/1 rounded-4">
      <img src="/50s-scientists.jpg" class="object-cover" alt="AI generated picture of 1950s scientists working on a warp drive" />
    </div>
  </container>
</width-controller>

```html
<div class="aspect-1/1">
  <img class="object-cover" src="..." alt="..." />
</div>
```

### Breakpoints and media queries

You can also use variant modifiers to target media queries like responsive breakpoints, dark mode, prefers-reduced-motion, and more. For example, use `md:aspect-1/1` to apply the `aspect-16/9` utility at only medium screen sizes and above.

```html
<iframe class="w-full aspect-16/9 md:aspect-1/1" src="..."></iframe>
```
