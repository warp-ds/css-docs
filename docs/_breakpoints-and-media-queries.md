### Breakpoints and media queries

You can also use variant modifiers to target media queries like responsive breakpoints, prefers-reduced-motion, and more. For example, use `md:row-span-4` to apply the `row-span-4` utility at only medium screen sizes and above.

```html{1}
<div class="row-span-3 md:row-span-4">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```
